# IB-VRST
The Influencer-Based Virtual Reality Stroop Test (IB-VRST) is an application that allows users to perform an immersive Stroop test while exposed to various virtual influencers. These influencers are categorized as task-related and non-task-related distractors, and elements of social presence implemented through competitive and collaborative virtual avatars. The application was validated through a user study involving a total of 102 volunteers who participated in two experiments where we analyzed the effects of these influencers on performance and stress levels. The results of the study are accessible [here]().

## Download
The application's executables are available in this repository's [release](https://github.com/CGVGroup/IB-VRST/releases) section. Download the main.zip file and inside you will find all the material needed to run the IB-VRST application.

## Install
Once the relese file has been downloaded you can unzip it and inside you will find two folders: **ib-vrst-distractors** e **ib-vrst-social**. Each folder is a different application, the former is the IB-VRST distractor version whereas the former is the social (avatar based) one. Inside each of these folder you will find one .exe file which will be the main entry point to start the application. Both the applications require Steam VR to be up and running. For each application there is a configuration file which can be customized, details are as follows. 

### ib-vrst-distractors
### ib-vrst-social
